# Chat GPT idea 

Desktop client that can bind a system keybind to tell gpt to "listen" to what you are saying. This input is then fed into to chatgpt and read back to you out loud.

The goal for this project is to create a seamless experience between the user and chatgpt , allowing you to easilly have "conversations" with it. My reason for creating this project is to introduce a feature that is not implemented in the webui of chatgpt or any alternative frontends I have found online. All alternatives require the user to click on the speaker icon to have the response read out loud. I don't like this , and I yearn for only 1 button I need to press to input my voice into a request and automatically have the response from chatgpt read out loud
