Github repo which holds markdown files 

## Goal

My objective is to create a service which allows me to access a hosted directory of markdown files on my mobile android device. My initial motive for this idea is to allow me to edit my grocery lists on my desktop and access them from my mobile device. This application should be self hosted and open source. 


## Why not just use google docs ?

I would not like to rely on a hosted 

## Questions 

- Can google docs render markdown ? 

- Can I use an FTP server ? If so , can I create a OpenVPN tunnel to my mobile device from my server  

    * May require configuring reverse proxy from server to host ( android device ) 

    * Could use SFTP ?

    * Use termux on android , create tunnel locally ?
