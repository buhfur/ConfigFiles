# JSON 

Recently i've been working on a project that installs addons for world of warcraft private server clients. I'm currently using a profile.json file to keep track of the Addon installation directories for each client. My plans are to support 1.12.1 ---> 4.3.4 plus other custom clients such as turtle wow and project epoch
