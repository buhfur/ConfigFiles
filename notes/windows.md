## Powershell configuration 

- Change Keybinds to Bash like keybinds 
    
    1. Check if `$PROFILE` variable exists 
        ```bash
        echo $PROFILE
        ```
    
    2. Open file in path listed in `echo $PROFILE`, in this case i'm using Vim but you can use any editor you like  
        ```bash
        vim $PROFILE
        ```

    3. Then , paste the following code into the file 
        ```bash
        # Load PSReadLine (should already be loaded in most cases)
        Import-Module PSReadLine

        # Map Bash-like key bindings
        Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Chord Ctrl+a -Function BeginningOfLine       # Move to start of line
        Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Chord Ctrl+e -Function EndOfLine             # Move to end of line
        Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Chord Ctrl+k -Function KillLine              # Delete text from cursor to end of line
        Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Chord Ctrl+u -Function BackwardDeleteLine    # Delete text from cursor to beginning of line
        Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Chord Ctrl+w -Function BackwardKillWord      # Delete previous word
        Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Chord Ctrl+y -Function Yank                  # Paste the last cut text
        Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Chord Ctrl+l -Function ClearScreen           # Clear screen
        ```

    
> The $PROFILE variable is a variable that contains the path to your windows "profile".ps1 , it can be named anything 
> but this is where you would keep all your custom configurations. In my case the variable contains the path of : 
> `C:\Users\username\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`
