# [ ] - Control thermal take fans with github daemon 

Found a daemon online that allows me to control the LED's on the fans , however, this is only a daemon and 
not an application. Woulden't be a bad idea in the future to develop one , or possibly add this daemon to OpenRGB 

**The link to the daemon is listed below**

# [ ] - fix the ryanm.site domain which is supposed to host my personal website
