# [ ] - App to display all my markdown files visually on a website 

Github page only hosts a static website that allows me to view my markdown notes


# [ ] - Extra  configuraton in .zshrc and bashrc to open up journal entries by passing the name of the journal entry 

Thinking of a way to view my journal entries by using a CLI command that's short 

Something like 

`journal linux`

Since all the markdown files have simple titles, ( AKA git.md , linux.md). 

Though for this I would need to find out how to get the CLI arg for the filename.

After reading further , I belive the "x$" symbols are used to get the args.

Also instead of using vim , I could use a  CLI markdown reader like glow , which I already have installed
