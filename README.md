# Summary 


This repository contains all the dotfiles I would use on a linux distro, the three main ones I use from here 
are 

1. .tmux.conf
2. .vimrc
3. .bashrc 




**What is this document used for ?**

1. dotfiles 
2. installation script for linux distros I put on my system
3. installation scripts for VM's on my proxmox hypervisor 
4. Acts as my central location for notes during my learning / projects


**Note**  

For some of my dotfiles I have extra configurations , such as the tmux-powerline, sometimes I will put the README.md document titled the name of the software to compile a pseudo manual for all my extra configurations. This is also so I don't have to search for info online sometimes.


**Tmux dotfile**

Quick side note , the tmux.conf is assuming  you are **NOT** using zsh as your shell , the two dotfiles  are the same except for setting the default terminal to zsh in .ztmux.conf


**Below is some additional software I use for customization**

---


# Tmux


## tmux-powerline 

Customizes the status bar in tmux. i've added 2 lines in the tmux.conf file to install the addon itself and some cool
themes for the powerline. Check the powerline-themes.md file in the manuals page using the link below
