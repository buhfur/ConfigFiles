# Summary 


This repository contains all the dotfiles I would use on a linux distro, the three main ones I use from here 
are 

1. .tmux.conf
2. .vimrc
3. .bashrc 

The rest were added by accident when I made a shell script to copy ALL dotfiles on my system to this directory. My plans are to change the "configure" shell script to just cat the three files above to my home directory.
