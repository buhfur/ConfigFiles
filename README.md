# Summary 


This repository contains all the dotfiles I would use on a linux distro, the three main ones I use from here 
are 

1. .tmux.conf
2. .vimrc
3. .bashrc 

The rest were added by accident when I made a shell script to copy ALL dotfiles on my system to this directory. My plans are to change the "configure" shell script to just cat the three files above to my home directory. 

This document may be called "config" but I use it for alot more 


*What is this document used for ?*

1. dotfiles 
2. installation script for linux distros I put on my system
3. installation scripts for VM's on my proxmox hypervisor 
4. Random notes , code snippets,  and one liners put in shell scripts or markdown documents
