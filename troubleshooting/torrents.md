# Troubleshooting torrenting issues for Linux torrenting clients 

## 1. Tracker issues
**Objective**: To design and implement a virtualized environment using Proxmox VE for hosting various services and tools for Security , Network Management , File Sharing, Media Hosting, and Storage efficient Backup / Archival solutions.

## 2. Client issues 
### Client Settings 
Depending on your BitTorrent Client , there can be instances of settings affecting a torrents download / upload. For this scenario I will be using Deluge, however in the future I intend on adding instructions for other GUI and CLI clients.

### Client Version 
Always make sure your client version is up to date. If your client is hosted on Github check if active issues with the version you have installed.

## 3. Connectivity issues
### WebUI 

In order to troubleshoot the WebUI for your client, there are a few things to consider. See below : 

* Is your client hosted on a remote machine ? or is it local ? 

* What message are you seeing when attempting to connect ? 

* Does the remote client store logs ? If so where are they found ? 

* If the client is OSS , Have you checked for any listed issues for the web client on the platform the repository is hosted on ? 

* If your client is remote , are you able to access the host the client is running on ? 

* On the remote client host ,
