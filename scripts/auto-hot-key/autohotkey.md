# flameshot.ahk 

Rebinds the print screen key on windows to the PgDn button , this is due to my keyboard not having a printscreen button , therefore the PgDn button is now the new print screen button 

# caps.ahk 

Simply swaps the CapsLock key and the escape key for me since I like to use escape in vim to exit edit mode 


# rebind.ahk 

Binds the windows key to the right Alt button , this is due to the windows key on my keyboard not functionion correctly.
