# Dotfiles 

This directory only contains my dotfiles that I use for some QoL in my day to day work. It might not be as plentiful or exciting, but it's the culmination of the last 2+ years of toying and tweaking with everything from I3 to VIM. In fact, I wrote some scripts to setup all these dotfiles with a VM or ordinary desktop. I mainly use Debian 12 and Almalinux so keep that in mind.





1. [Ztmux.c](dotfiles/ztmux.conf)
2. [Tmux.c](dotfiles/tmux.conf)
3. [Vi](dotfiles/vimrc)
4. [Bashrc](dotfiles/bashrc)
5. [Xinit](dotfiles/xinitrc)
6. [Zshrc](dotfiles/zshrc)
