Some UI add-ons may not show the help request button. If so, you can use the script below:
```
/script NewGMTicket(1,"text")
```
The average response to tickets are 24-48 hours, sometimes longer depending on your inquiry and workload. The system message in the ticket UI is arbitrary and does not mean anything, so disregard it.
