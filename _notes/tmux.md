# Run tmux with diff config file 

`tmux -f .something.conf`


# Change default terminal 

Put this in your .tmux.conf file , the example below changes the default shell to zsh  

`set -g default-shell /bin/zsh`

# Reload configuration file 



# Tmux idea 

I would like to implement a line in the config file to download TPM automatically and refresh the config
